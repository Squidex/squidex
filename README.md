# What is Squidex?

Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. In contrast to a traditional CMS Squidex provides a rich API with OData filter and Swagger definitions. It is up to you to build your UI on top of it. It can be website, a native app or just another server. We build it with ASP.NET Core and CQRS and is tested for Windows and Linux on modern browsers.

## Cloud Version

Although Squidex is free we are also working on a Saas version on [https://cloud.squidex.io](https://cloud.squidex.io) (More information coming soon). We have also have plans to sell a premium version with first class support and some exlusive features. But don't be afraid, our first priority is to deliver a state of the art, stable, fast and free content management hub to make the life for developers a little bit easier.
