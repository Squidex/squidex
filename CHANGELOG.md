## 5.1.0 - 2020-10-20

### Breaking Changes

This version introduces a few small breaking changes. The support for https redirects and `X-FORWARDED-*` headers has been removed. Squidex does not provide a solution for https and it is the responsibility of the reverse proxy like nginx, caddy, IIS or Cloudflare to terminate https requests. Therefore it does not make sense to care about https redirects anyway. The support for `X-FORWARDED-*` headers has been removed because it was possible to solve it with the mandatory `urls:baseUrls` setting in an easier way.

This version also comes with new docker image versioning, each version is now tagged with the concrete version and the major version only, e.g.

* squidex/squidex:5
* squidex/squidex:5.1

Furthermore the docker-compose files are updated with a simpler approach to use [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy for https termination:

https://github.com/Squidex/squidex-docker/blob/master/standalone/docker-compose.yml


### Features

### Bugfixes

* **UI**: Fixed the route synchronizer.
* **UI**: Fix a few spelling errors.
* **UI**: Fixes checkboxes for custom roles.
* **Assets**: Fix asset urls in GraphQL.

## 5.0.0 - 2020-10-08

This feature adds custom IDs to the system. So far every ID like a content ID is globally unique. This means that you cannot create custom IDs and when a backup is restored you need to assign new ids, because the old IDs might be already in use.

With this version on, every ID is prefixed with the app id, meaning they are only unique within an app. This allows new endpoints for upserting contents and defininig custom ids for assets.

### WARNING: MIGRATION

This version has to migrate a few mongo collections:

* Events
* States_AssetFolders
* States_Assets
* State_Contents_All
* State_Contents_Published

This process will start automatically and can take a while. To be backwards compatible when you experience a bug, new collections are created. The new collection names are

* Events2
* States_AssetFolders2
* States_Assets2
* States_Contents_All2
* States_Contents_Published2

(As you can see the collection names have been streamlined.)

If everything works fine for you, you can delete the old collections.

## 5.0.0 BETA 1 - 2020-07-06

This version introduces a new way to deal with ids. So far each content element has an id that is unique across all apps. This causes problems, because you cannot define your own ids and the ids have to change when you clone an app via backup and restore.

With this version ids for content items and assets are only unique within an app.

To make this possible, this version rebuilds all content items, assets and asset folders which can take a few minutes.

## 4.0.0 - 2019-11-13

### Breaking Changes

#### List Fields

This feature contains a major update how reference fields and list fields are managed. In previous versions, schema fields had the properties `IsListField` or `IsReferenceField` to indicate whether a field should be shown in content lists or not. This was hard to manage in the UI and you could not specify the order. With this release schemas contain list of field names that should be used as list fields or reference fields. List field names can also contain meta fields like the content id or the content author. But we have decided not to implement a migration for that. If you use the feature you have to configure these fields again. Please not that the API is not affected and it is very likely not a breaking change for your consuming applications.

#### .NET Core 3.0

Migration to .NET Core 3.0. This also includes some code changes such as cleanup of configuration and proper nullable support.

This version does not use alpine image with self contained image any more. Therefore the final image is larger than before but the Squidex layer itself is smaller, which means a reduced disk size and download size when you update Squidex or when you have multiple versions installed or other .NET Core applications on your servers.

#### Clustering

This version introduces a new storage to communicate cluster members. Therefore it is recommended not to use a rolling deployment and restart the entire cluster instead.

### Features

* **UI**: New approach to manage list fields and schema fields.
* **UI**: Many small UI / UX improvements.

### Bugfixes
